# Neural Network
Artificial neural network is a kind of dynamic system that imitates many basic properties of the complex structure of the human brain, and it also has another name: connection model. Neural networks are used in a wide variety of fields, including image recognition, speech processing, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. The core component of a neural network is a neuron, which is a mathematical model that simulates biological neurons. Each neuron receives inputs from other neurons and processes these inputs through an activation function to produce an output. Neurons in a neural network are usually divided into different layers, including the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The input layer receives raw data as input, the hidden layer processes intermediate features and the output layer generates the final prediction or output.

I once used the neural network to diagnose transformer faults. After training the BP neural network based on the conjugate gradient method with 20 sets of data, I used 16 sets of test sample data to diagnose the network. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy was A good result at 87.5%.

With the rise of deep learning, the deep neural network has become an important branch of neural networks. Deep neural networks consist of multiple hidden layers that can learn and represent more complex patterns and abstract concepts. It has achieved many breakthroughs in the fields of image, speech, and natural language processing, and plays an important role in the development of artificial intelligence.
